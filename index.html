    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Dina, and I am currently living in the vibrant city of Skopje, Macedonia. I also proudly embrace my Croatian heritage.I was born on 5th of March 2004. I am a student at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (FINKI), where I am pursuing my passion for technology and innovation.

      I completed my high school education at Georgi Dimitrov, where I developed a strong foundation in various subjects and discovered my interest in computer science. My multicultural background and diverse educational experiences have shaped me into a well-rounded individual with a broad perspective on life and learning.

      At FINKI, I am engaged in various projects and activities that challenge me to grow both academically and personally. I am always eager to learn new skills, collaborate with peers, and contribute to the field of computer science.

      In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, working on personal projects, and staying connected with my cultural roots in both Macedonia and Croatia.</p>
